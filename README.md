This example demonstrates a common pitfall in PHP when working with pass-by-reference and arrays.  While PHP uses pass-by-value by default, arrays passed with the `&` symbol are passed by reference. However, this doesn't mean all changes are reflected everywhere. Assigning the reference to a new variable creates a copy, resulting in unexpected behavior when changes are made through the copy.  This is different from languages that always pass arrays by reference.
